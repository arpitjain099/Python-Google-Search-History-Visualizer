# Python-Google-Search-History-Visualizer
Today Google rolled out its feature which allows users to export their search history ranging back to the time when you first created the email address! This piece of code allows you to visualize your google search history into a single HTML page (all your stuff, good or bad! ;)). Copy paste the file result.py into the directory created after extracting the zipped search history file. Run the file result.py and see the magic!!
